== 0.5.3 :: 2010-06-21

* Added cookie support
* Added JSON support

== 0.5.2 :: 2009-03-18

* Use xml_in instead of xml_in_string to process XML.

== 0.5.1 :: 2009-01-30

* Fixed error in the way the request_timeout value was being set.

== 0.5.0 :: 2009-01-07

* A logger can be provided on a per-call basis, rather than just for the
  Restr class as a whole. 
  e.g.:
    kitten_logger = Logger.new('kitten.log'} 
    Restr.get('http://example.com/kittens/1.xml, {}, {:logger => kitten_logger}) 

== 0.4.0 :: 2008-06-19

* Better recognition of XML content; response MIME types ending in "/xml" and
  "+xml" are now all parsed as XML (for example: "application/xml", 
  "image/svg+xml", "text/xml", etc). Note that "application/xhtml+xml" is now
  considered to be XML content too, even though you may think of it as just
  "HTML".
* You can set how long Restr will wait for a request to complete by  setting 
  Restr.request_timeout = <seconds>. The default timeout is 3  minutes 
  (180 seconds).
* The full response body is now included in DEBUG-level log entries. Be careful
  if you have the logging level set to DEBUG -- your log will now grow very
  quickly.

== 0.3.0 :: 2008-04-03

* First public release -- moved out from the Reststop library into its own gem.
